# Automatic Speaker Detection System - Implementation Status

## 🎤 Feature Overview
Successfully implemented automatic speaker detection for live transcription that intelligently identifies when speakers change and labels them as Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc. without requiring manual intervention.

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

### Core Features Implemented:

#### 1. **Audio Analysis Engine** 
- **Voice Fingerprinting**: Extracts unique voice characteristics including:
  - Pitch frequency analysis (fundamental frequency detection)

  - MFCC-like coefficients (voice texture/quality)
  - Energy levels (volume characteristics)

#### 2. **Speaker Change Detection**
- **Real-time Analysis**: Continuously monitors voice characteristics during speech
- **Similarity Algorithm**: Compares current voice against known speaker profiles
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for speaker identification
- **Threshold-based Detection**: Configurable sensitivity for speaker changes

#### 3. **Automatic Speaker Management**
- **Auto-labeling**: Automatically assigns "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2", etc.
- **Profile Learning**: Continuously improves speaker recognition accuracy
- **Speaker History**: Maintains speaker change timeline and statistics
- **Seamless Integration**: Works alongside existing manual speaker controls

#### 4. **Enhanced User Interface**
- **Real-time Indicators**: Shows current detected speaker and system status
- **Detection Controls**: Toggle automatic detection on/off
- **Speaker History**: Displays recent speaker changes with timestamps
- **Visual Feedback**: Green indicators for auto-detected speakers in transcripts
