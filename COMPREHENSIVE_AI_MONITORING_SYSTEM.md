- **Error Detection**: Identifies and resolves authentication issues

### 2. 🛡️ Security Risk Assessment
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Monitors for unusual API usage patterns
- **Login Security**: Tracks failed login attempts and brute force attempts
- **System Vulnerabilities**: Checks for known security issues
- **Data Integrity**: Verifies backup status and data corruption
- **Risk Level Classification**: Low, Medium, High risk assessment

### 3. 📊 Website Performance Metrics
- **Active User Count**: Real-time user tracking
- **Server Response Time**: Website performance monitoring
- **Error Rate Analysis**: Tracks website errors and issues
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Server availability tracking
- **Performance Optimization**: Identifies slow-loading components

### 4. ⚙️ System Health Monitoring
- **CPU Usage**: Monitors processor utilization
- **Memory Usage**: RAM consumption tracking
- **Disk Space**: Storage availability monitoring
- **Network Health**: Connection quality and latency
- **Service Status**: Database, file storage, email services

### 5. 🎬 Processing Engine Status
- **Active Jobs**: Current transcription/processing jobs
- **Queue Management**: Processing queue size and wait times
- **Stuck File Detection**: Automatically identifies hung processes
- **Performance Metrics**: Average processing times
- **Error Rate Tracking**: Processing failure rates

### 6. 👥 User Activity Analysis
- **Registration Trends**: New user sign-ups
- **Session Analytics**: User engagement metrics

- **Growth Trends**: User retention and activity patterns
- **Transcription Volume**: Daily usage statistics

## 🔧 Automatic Fixes Applied

The AI system can automatically resolve these issues:

1. **API Quota Exceeded** → Switches to backup API key
2. **Authentication Errors** → Resets API configuration
3. **Server Errors (5xx)** → Retries with exponential backoff
4. **Network Issues** → Multiple retry attempts with delays
5. **Stuck Processing Files** → Automatic cleanup and recovery
6. **Memory Issues** → Process optimization recommendations

## 📈 Dashboard Metrics

The system tracks and reports:

| Metric | Description | Threshold |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| API Health | % of APIs functioning | >90% healthy |
| Response Time | Server response speed | <5 seconds |
| Error Rate | Website error percentage | <5% |
| Security Risk | Risk assessment level | Low preferred |
| Processing Speed | Avg transcription time | <10 minutes |
| User Growth | Daily active users | Positive trend |

## 🚨 Alert Levels

### 🟢 **HEALTHY** (Green)
- All systems operational
