# Transcription vs Translation: Key Differences and When to Use Each

Many people confuse transcription and translation, but they serve very different purposes in content processing. Understanding when to use each service can save time, money, and ensure you get the right results for your project.

## What is Transcription?

**Transcription** is the process of converting spoken words from audio or video recordings into written text in the **same language**. The transcriber (human or AI) listens to the audio and types exactly what they hear.

**Example:**
- **Audio (English):** "Welcome to our meeting. Today we'll discuss quarterly results."
- **Transcription (English):** "Welcome to our meeting. Today we'll discuss quarterly results."

### Types of Transcription

1. **Verbatim Transcription**
   - Includes every word, pause, "um," and "uh"
   - Used for legal proceedings, research
   - Example: "So, um, I think we should, uh, consider this option."

2. **Clean Verbatim**
   - Removes filler words but keeps all meaningful content
   - Most common for business and media
   - Example: "I think we should consider this option."

3. **Intelligent Transcription**
   - Edited for readability and clarity
   - May rearrange sentences for better flow
   - Used for content creation and publishing

## What is Translation?

**Translation** is the process of converting written or spoken content from one language to another while preserving meaning, context, and cultural nuance.

**Example:**
- **Source (English):** "Welcome to our meeting. Today we'll discuss quarterly results."
- **Translation (Spanish):** "Bienvenidos a nuestra reunión. Hoy discutiremos los resultados trimestrales."

### Types of Translation

1. **Document Translation**
   - Converting written text between languages
   - Maintains formatting and structure
   - Used for contracts, manuals, websites

2. **Audio Translation**
   - Converting spoken content to text in different language
   - Combines transcription + translation
   - Used for international content localization

3. **Localization**
   - Translation adapted for specific regions/cultures
   - Considers local customs, currency, references
   - Used for global marketing and software

## Key Differences: Transcription vs Translation

| Aspect | Transcription | Translation |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Speech to text (same language) | Language conversion |
| **Input** | Audio/video files | Text or audio in source language |

| **Skills Required** | Good hearing, typing speed, language knowledge | Bilingual fluency, cultural understanding |
| **Time Required** | 3-4x audio length | 2-5x transcription time |
| **Cost** | $0-2 per minute | $0.10-0.30 per word |
| **Accuracy Needs** | 95-99% word accuracy | 99%+ meaning accuracy |
